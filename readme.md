## Features

- [x] Comprehensive – it combines **software and hardware**, **behavioral task design and experimental data collection**.
- [x] Inexpensive – neither dedicated nor expensive hardware is essential.
- [x] General purpose - it’s applicable to **multiple behavioral tasks**.
- [x] Easy to use – behavior task can be decomposed by the straightforward State Notation concept, and designed via a friendly GUI **without need to master script language**. You are free from knownledge about C++ / Arduino / Matlab coding.
- [x] Real-time performance – it has **high temporal resolution (<1ms)** and **free from the load of computer**.

## Requirements

- Windows 7/10
- Arduino IDE
